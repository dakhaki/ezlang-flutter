      "content": "## 1. Nouns: Naming Your World\nA **Noun** is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. \n\n### Common vs. Proper Nouns\n*   **Common Nouns:** General things (city, man, phone, cat).\n*   **Proper Nouns:** Specific names. They always start with a **Capital Letter** (London, Mr. Smith, iPhone, Saturday).\n\n### Singular and Plural Nouns\n*   **Singular (One):** A book, a desk, a child.\n*   **Plural (More than one):** Two books, three desks, five children.\n*   *Rule: Usually, we add '-s' to make a noun plural (Car → Cars).* \n\n## 2. Pronouns: Replacing the Names\n**Pronouns** are short words we use so we don't have to repeat the same noun many times.\n\n| Subject Pronoun | Possessive Adjective | Example Sentence |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **I** | **My** | I have a bag. It is **my** bag. |\n| **You** | **Your** | You have a key. It is **your** key. |\n| **He** | **His** | He has a dog. It is **his** dog. |\n| **She** | **Her** | She has a car. It is **her** car. |\n| **It** | **Its** | The cat has food. It is **its** food. |\n| **We** | **Our** | We have a house. It is **our** house. |\n| **They** | **Their** | They have books. They are **their** books. |\n\n--- \n\n## Practice Conversations\n\n### Sample Conversation 1: At the Office (2026 Tech Scene)\n> **A:** Excuse me, is this **your** tablet? \n> **B:** No, it isn't. **I** have **my** tablet here in **my** backpack.\n> **A:** Maybe it is **Sarah's**. **She** was here in the **office** earlier.\n> **B:** You are right. **It** belongs to **her**. Let's call **her**.\n\n### Sample Conversation 2: Meeting Neighbors\n> **A:** Hi! **We** are the new **neighbors**. **Our** names are Tom and Lily.\n> **B:** Welcome! **My** name is Marcus. Do **you** live in that **house**?\n> **A:** Yes, **we** do. And this is **our** dog, Sparky.\n> **B:** **He** is very friendly! **His** fur is so soft.\n\n### Sample Conversation 3: Finding a Lost Phone\n> **A:** Look! There is a **phone** on the **bench**. \n> **B:** Is it **your** phone, David?\n> **A:** No, **my** phone is blue. That **phone** is black. \n> **B:** See those **people** over there? Maybe it is **their** phone.\n\n### Sample Conversation 4: In the Classroom\n> **Teacher:** Students, please take out **your** laptops.\n> **Student:** Teacher, **I** can't find **my** laptop. \n> **Teacher:** Is it in **your** locker? \n> **Student:** Oh! **It** is under **my** chair. **I** am sorry!\n\n### Sample Conversation 5: Shopping for Gifts\n> **A:** I want to buy a **gift** for **my** mother. \n> **B:** Does **she** like **books**? \n> **A:** Yes, **she** loves **them**. **Her** favorite **writer** is Mark Twain.\n> **B:** Look at this **book**. **Its** cover is beautiful. **She** will love it!\n\n--- \n\n## Grammar Tip: Possessive 's\nWhen we want to show that a **Noun** owns something, we add **'s**:\n*   **The teacher's** pen. (The pen belongs to the teacher).\n*   **John's** car. (The car belongs to John).\n*   **My parents'** house. (The house belongs to my parents — *note: the ' is after the 's' for plurals*)."
