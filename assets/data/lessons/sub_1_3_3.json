Indefinite Articles: A and An\nWe use **'a'** and **'an'** when we talk about a person or thing for the **first time**, or if it is not a specific one (any one of its kind).\n\n*   **Use 'A'** before words that start with a **consonant sound**: *a doctor, a phone, a big house.*\n*   **Use 'An'** before words that start with a **vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u)**: *an apple, an umbrella, an email.*\n\n## 2. The Definite Article: The\nWe use **'the'** when we talk about a specific person or thing that both the speaker and listener already know about.\n\n*   **First time:** \"I have **a** cat.\"\n*   **Second time:** \"**The** cat is hungry.\"\n*   **Unique things:** \"**The** sun,\" \"**The** world,\" \"**The** internet.\"\n\n## 3.
