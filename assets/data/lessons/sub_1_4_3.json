      "content": "## Finding Your Way\nAsking for directions requires specific nouns and prepositions. Using \"the\" is vital because you are usually looking for one specific place.\n\n### 1. Key Vocabulary\n*   **Common Places:** Restroom/Toilet, Entrance, Exit, Pharmacy, Bank, Station.\n*   **Positions:** Left, Right, Straight, Behind, Next to, Across from.\n*   **Travel:** Map, GPS, Address, Ticket Office.\n\n### 2. Grammar: Prepositions and Possessives\nWe use possessives to clarify which specific location we mean:\n*   \"**Where is the** exit?\"\n*   \"Is the bank **on my** left?\"\n*   \"**Your** hotel is next to the park.\"\n*   \"**My** office is across from the station.\"\n\n### 3. Expanded Conversations\n**Scenario A: Inside a Large Mall**\n> **Visitor:** Excuse me, **where is the** restroom?\n> **Security:** Go straight. It is **on your** right, **next to** the cinema.\n> **Visitor:** Thank you. And **where is the** exit to the parking lot?\n> **Security:** It is **behind** you. Look for **the** green sign.\n\n**Scenario B: Lost in the City**\n> **Tourist:** Hello! I am lost. **Where is the** Grand Hotel?\n> **Local:** Oh, **your** hotel is far.
