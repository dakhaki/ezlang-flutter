      "content": "## Your Living Space: Objects and Locations\nTo describe your home accurately, you must know the names of objects and exactly where they are placed. In 2026, many homes also include smart devices and multi-purpose spaces.\n\n### 1. Expanded Room Vocabulary\n*   **Living Room:** **Sofa**, **Armchair**, **Bookshelf**, **Coffee Table**, and **Smart TV**.\n*   **Kitchen:** **Fridge**, **Microwave**, **Dishwasher**, **Cupboard**, and **Sink**.\n*   **Bedroom:** **Bed**, **Desk**, **Laptop**, **Wardrobe**, and **Nightstand**.\n*   **Bathroom:** **Shower**, **Towels**, **Mirror**, **Toothbrush**, and **Sink**.\n\n### 2.

Grammar: Possessives (Whose thing is it?)\nIn a shared house, it is important to identify owners:\n*   \"This is **my** laptop, but that is **your** tablet.\"\n*   \"Where are **Emily's** keys?\"\n*   \"Our **parents'** room is upstairs.\"\n\n--- \n\n## Practice Conversations\n\n### Sample Conversation 1: Setting up a Smart Home\n> **A:** Where should we put the new **Smart Speaker**?\n> **B:** Let's put it **on** the **bookshelf** in the **living room**.\n> **A:** Is it **next to** the **TV**?\n> **B:** No, put it **between** the books and the **lamp** so it can hear us clearly.\n\n### Sample Conversation 2: Looking for Kitchen Tools\n> **Son:** Mom, I can't find **my** favorite mug. Is it in the **dishwasher**?\n> **Mom:** No, I washed it. It is in the **cupboard** **above** the **fridge**.\n> **Son:** I see it! And where is **Dad's** coffee spoon?\n> **Mom:** It is **on** the **table**, right **next to** the **microwave**.\n\n### Sample Conversation 3: At a Guest House (Airbnb Scenario)\n> **Guest:** Excuse me, where can I find extra **towels**?\n> **Host:** They are in the **bathroom**, **under** the **sink**.\n> **Guest:** Great. And is there a **laptop desk** in the **bedroom**?\n> **Host:** Yes, it is **behind** the **wardrobe**. **Your** room key is on the **nightstand**.\n\n### Sample Conversation 4: Cleaning the Bedroom\n> **A:** Whose **pillows** are these on the floor?\n> **B:** Those are **my** pillows. Sorry, I'll put them back **on** the **bed**.\n> **A:** Please put **your** clothes **in** the **wardrobe** too. The room looks messy!\n> **B:** Okay, I'll put my shoes **under** the **desk** as well.\n\n### Sample Conversation 5: Moving Furniture\n> **Husband:** Does the **sofa** look good here?\n> **Wife:** I think it's better **behind** the **coffee table**.\n> **Husband:** What about **our** old **armchair**?\n> **Wife:** Let's move it to the corner, **next to** the **window** so we can read in the sun.\n\n--- \n\n## Grammar Tip: 'There is' vs. 'There are'\n*   Use **There is** for one object: *\"**There is** a mirror in the bathroom.\"*\n*   Use **There are** for many objects: *\"**There are** four chairs in the kitchen.\"*"
