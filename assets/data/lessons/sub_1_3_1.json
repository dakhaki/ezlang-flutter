      "content": "## Introduction to 'To Be'\nThe verb **'to be'** is the most common verb in English. We use it to talk about names, ages, jobs, feelings, and locations. Unlike other verbs, it changes its form depending on the subject and the time (Present or Past).\n\n### 1. Present Tense: Am, Is, Are\nUse the present tense for facts happening **now**.\n\n| Subject | Positive | Negative | Contraction (Short Form) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **I** | I am | I am not | I'm |\n| **You/We/They** | are | are not | You're / We're / They're |\n| **He/She/It** | is | is not | He's / She's / It's |\n\n**Examples:**\n*   \"I **am** a student.\"\n*   \"They **are** at the office.\"\n*   \"**Is** your phone on the table?\"\n\n### 2. Past Tense: Was, Were\nUse the past tense for things that happened **yesterday** or in the **past**.\n\n| Subject | Positive | Negative | Contraction |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **I/He/She/It** | was | was not | wasn't |\n| **You/We/They** | were | were not | weren't |\n\n**Examples:**\n*   \"Yesterday **was** Saturday.\"\n*   \"We **were** happy at the party.\"\n*   \"**Were** you at home last night?\"\n\n### 3. Combining 'To Be' with Possessives\nWe use 'to be' to identify who owns an object:\n*   \"This **is my** laptop.\"\n*   \"Those **were his** keys.\"\n*   \"**Is** that **your** car?\"\n\n--- \n\n## Practice Conversations\n\n### Sample Conversation 1: Meeting a New Colleague (Present)\n> **A:** Hi! I **am** Alex. **Are** you the new designer?\n> **B:** Yes, I **am**. My name **is** Maria. It **is** nice to meet you!\n> **A:** **Is** this **your** desk?\n> **B:** No, it **is not**. **My** desk **is** over there, next to the window.\n\n### Sample Conversation 2: Talking About Yesterday (Past)\n> **A:** Where **were** you yesterday afternoon? You **weren't** at the meeting.\n> **B:** I **was** at the hospital. **My** daughter **was** sick.\n> **A:** Oh no! **Was** it serious?\n> **B:** No, she **is** fine now. She **was** just very tired.\n\n### Sample Conversation 3: Checking Travel Photos (Present & Past)\n> **A:** This photo **is** beautiful! Where **was** it?\n> **B:** That **was** in Japan last summer. The weather **was** perfect.\n> **A:** **Are** these **your** friends in the photo?\n> **B:** Yes, they **are**. They **were** **my** roommates in college.\n\n### Sample Conversation 4: Identifying Lost Objects (Possessives)\n> **A:** Excuse me, **is** this **your** umbrella? It **was** under the chair.\n> **B:** No, it **isn't mine**. **My** umbrella **is** blue. This one **is** black.\n> **A:** Maybe it **is** **Sarah's**. She **was** here a minute ago.\n> **B:** You **are** right! It **is** **her** umbrella.\n\n### Sample Conversation 5: A Video Call (2026 Tech Scenario)\n> **Teacher:** **Are** you ready for **our** lesson?\n> **Student:** I **am** sorry, I **am** a bit late. **My** internet connection **was** very slow this morning.\n> **Teacher:** That **is** okay. **Is** **your** microphone working now?\n> **Student:** Yes, it **is**. We **are** ready to start!\n\n--- \n\n## Grammar Tip: Asking Questions\nTo ask a question with 'to be', just switch the order of the subject and the verb:\n*   Statement: **You are** tired. → Question: **Are you** tired?\n*   Statement: **It was** cold. → Question: **Was it** cold?"
